class Flip(QuantumEffect):
    """Flips a qubit in |0> to |1> and vice versa.

    For a partial flip, use the `effect_fraction` argument.

    These effects will be cumulative.  For instance, two quarter
    flips (effect_fraction=0.25) will be equivalent to a half
    flip (effect_fraction=0.5).

    Note that most fractions will not produce the corresponding
    probabiltity distribution.  For instance, a effect_fraction
    of 0.25 will not produce a 25%/75% probability distribution
    of outcomes.

    Args:
        effect_fraction: Amount of flip effect to perform.
            This results in an exponentiation of the flip (X)
            effect.  A fraction of 1.0 corresponds to a full
            flip (this is the default).  A fraction of 0.5
            corresponds to a half flip (square root of NOT)
            and a fraction of 0.0 has no effect.

    on the |0> and |1> states, but can change the phase (complex sign)

    A full phase is the same as a 180Â° rotation around the Z axis, or a Z gate.
