class Flip(QuantumEffect):
    """Flips two states of a qubit, leaving all other states unchanged.

    For instance, Flip(state0 = 0, state1=2) is a qutrit effect
    that flips |0> to |2>, |2> to |0> and leaves
    |1> alone.  This is also sometimes referred to as the X_0_2 gate.

    For a partial flip, use the `effect_fraction` argument.
    Note that this is only applied so far on qubits and not yet for
    qudits.

    These effects will be cumulative.  For instance, two quarter
    flips (effect_fraction=0.25) will be equivalent to a half
    flip (effect_fraction=0.5).

    Note that most fractions will not produce the corresponding
    probabiltity distribution.  For instance, a effect_fraction
    of 0.25 will not produce a 25%/75% probability distribution
    of outcomes.

    Args:
        effect_fraction: Amount of flip effect to perform.
            This results in an exponentiation of the flip (X)
            effect.  A fraction of 1.0 corresponds to a full
            flip (this is the default).  A fraction of 0.5
            corresponds to a half flip (square root of NOT)
        state0: The source state to be flipped.  For instance,
            if state0=1, this will flip the |1> state to the
            state specified in state1.
        state1: The destination state to be flipped to.
